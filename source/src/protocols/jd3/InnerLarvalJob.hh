/// for a given job - how many nstruct, and what the input is.  %InnerLarvalJobs are
/// relatively heavy; there is no need to duplicate a series of %InnerLarvalJobs for
/// each index into nstruct.  The companion Job class handles the nstruct index
/// and has a pointer to an InnerLarvalJob (which is shared across many Jobs).
/// The JobQueen has considerable leeway in how she shares data held in the %InnerLarvalJobs
/// she creates: if all of the options for a set of %InnerLarvalJob are identical, and
/// they differ only in their input structure, then she can, e.g. share a single
/// JobOptions object between all of them.
/// InnerLarvalJobs are serialized by the JobDistributor and shipped between nodes.  For this
/// reason, they should not be loaded with ResourceManager-managed data (that data should
/// not get shipped between nodes, though it should be instantiatable on any node), but they
/// may need to store Poses, as would be necessary in any multi-round protocol, where the
/// JobResults from round i are the starting points for round i+1.
